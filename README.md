# TxtCompare
For comparing 2 .txt files. Uses a hashtable.

This program compares two text files.
All the words of the first file are read and
saved to a global 2d char-array hash-table.
If reading and saving the first file is
succesful, the program then starts reading
a second file, and prints the 50 unique words
in that file not found in the first file.
